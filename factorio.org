** Power
- 1 pump - 20 boilers - 40 steam engines -> 36MW
  - so 1:2 boiler to steam engine
- 25 Solar Panels - 21 Accumulators -> 1MW
*** Nuclear
- Simple Ratio - 40MW
  - 1 Reactor
  - 1 Offshore Pump
  - 4 Heat pumps
  - 7 Turbines
- Common Ratio - 480MW
  - 4 Reactor
  - 5 Offshore Pump
  - 48 Heat pumps
  - 83 Turbines
- Use storage tanks as buffers
** Oil
- Simple Cracking - 8 crude - 1 heavy light - 7 petro light
- Accurate Cracking - 25 crude - 3 heavy light - 21 petro light
** Other
- 3 coil assemblers feeding 2 green circuit
- Alex's solar/accumulator blueprint
- one-space gap between walls and turrets
  - otherwise medium and large biters can bite turrets directly
- Starting build
  - Burner miners - 1 stone, 4-6 for iron, 1-2 for copper, 2-4 on coal
* V2 server plan
** Themes
- city layout
  - preserve the walkways!!!
- layout to grid
- consistent layout
  - use more blueprints, maybe even for things like power poles (so they have lights?)
  - can we hotkey this better?
- Use trains more
  - trains in V1 don't seem to provide a benefit over belts/pipeline?
  - Should we start out planning to go further out?
- Avoid hand crafting
- I don't like running out of ore every hour
  - Backfill ore - deposit runs into next one, even though just sitting idle
  - use slow mining
** Map settings
- maybe rail world?
- Starting area - very large
- Resource Frequency - lower to increase size of deposits
- Cliff frequency - low
- resource size - large or very large
- cliff size - small to avoid bug
- resource richness - very high
** Game settings
- biters off or biters passive
  - or maybe use pollution cleaner mod, much better pollution dissapation, slower evolution curve
